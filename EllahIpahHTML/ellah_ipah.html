			<p class = "text">When Game Of Thrones season five ended, Jon was dead, Arya was blind, Daenerys was a prisoner of the Dothraki, Cersei still had one remaining child, and winter was coming. When it finished, Jon was alive, Arya could see, Dany was the commander of the Dothraki, Cersei had lost her last son but gained the Iron Throne, and winter had finally come. Big wheel keep on turnin’, Proud Mary keep on burnin’.</p>
			

			<p class = "text">Burnin’ was a theme of season six, which saw several women violently seize power, often by setting fire to stuff. Dany burnt a tentful of Khals to death and assumed control of their Khalasar, Cersei exploded the Great Sept of Baelor with wildfire and was crowned Queen of Westeros.</p>

			<h2>What Has Gone Down in Season 7</h2>
			<img id="dany-jon" src="img/jon_and_dany.jpg" alt="Jon and Dany">
			<p class= "text">If you'll recall (it was just last month actually), this whole thing started with local neckbeard Samwell Tarly literally cleaning shit and doing some light reading in the Citadel library. There (in the very Harry Potter restricted section) he finds the key to killing the White Walkers: Dragonglass. He sends a note to Jon Snow via the stunningly reliable Westeros Raven Service that they need to get a-minin' down in Dragonstone. This sends Jon on a very quick trip down South for the much anticipated meeting with Daenerys Targaryen, who has just landed on her home turf.</p>
			
			<p class = "text">In order to get his beloved dragonglass, Jon Snow heads south to finally meet Daenerys. It's an awkward meeting, as these things go. She wants him to bend the knee. He refuses, but ultimately they agree to work together to fight Cersei, and Daenerys gives Jon permission to mine the dragonglass.</p>

			<p class = "text"></p>

			<h2>Will They Won't They? Is She, Is He?</h2>
			<p class="text">One of the leading Game of Thrones theories is that Jon Snow is Azor Ahai. This Azor Ahai is a legendary figure throughout George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire "who fought against [the darkness] with a red sword" and "arose to give courage to the race of men and lead the virtuous into battle with his blazing sword Lightbringer." According to prophecy, "When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone."</p>
			
			<img id="throne-pic" src="img/throne.jpg" alt = "The Throne">
			
			<p class="text">Tonight, Melisandre and Daenerys had a brief but very important conversation about the Prince That Was Promised. During their discussion, Missandei steps in with a pretty big "Um, actually" by correcting the translation of Melisandre's prophecy. It turns out the word for prince has no gender—meaning it could be a princess who was promised rather than a prince. That would mean instead of Jon Snow being the Lord of Light, it could be Daenerys. </p>
